This repo is a collection of code from programs made in this class.

> ### 'Deque' - Doubly ended queue:<br>
> A deque is somewhat an abstract generalization of a queue for which you can add elements to the 'head' (front) or 'tail' (back).<br>
> Its operations are: <br>
> - 'insertLeft()': which inserts a value on the left, or tail end.
> - 'insertRight()': which inserts a value on the right, or head.
> - 'deleteLeft()'/'deleteRight()': as the name implies, deletes from the left/right end.
> - 'isEmpty()'/'isFull()': checks if the list is empty or full.
>> ### 'Stack' - Stack based on a Deque:<br>
>> As its name implies, this is a stack which utilizes the Deque class.
>> Its operations are: <br>
>> - 'push()': puts an item in the stack.
>> - 'pop()': removes the head item and returns its value.
>> - 'peek()': returns the value of the head item.
